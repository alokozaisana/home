		<h2>My superpowers</h2>
		<p>First, before I discuss my superpowers. Do you know what superpower is? Do you have a superpower? Or you might have it but you don't know about it. Well, then you are on the right page. So, what is a superpower? Superpower is kind of like an ability where you can do certain things while other people can not. There are many types of super powers such as Telepathy, teleportation, shape shifting, magic, invisibility, immortality, mind reading and so on and on. Everyone has a different superpower and some people might not. For me, My superpowers are Healing and invisibility.</p>
		<h2>What it is, how I got it?</h2>
		<p>What is it? Invisibility is that when you can move around or anywhere you want to be and no one would be able to see you. So, without being observed. You can choose to let certain people see you while staying invisible to others. And healing is when you can heal people. You can restore living organisms to their optimal health, curing damaged or withered organisms, wounds, broken bones, low vitality, and diseases/poisoning. Though you may potentially heal any form of bodily damage, the patient must be alive, even if hanging by a thin thread, in order to be healed. How you would heal them is you put your hand on the part they are hurt or just anywhere you want. That would heal them but it will make you exhausted depended on the injury. Now coming to the part how I got my powers. This is an interesting question some people might not be able to answer this question. Because it just came to them naturally without them doing a task but for me, it was different till last year. When my mom told me that I had superpowers and I was shocked and excited as well to use it as soon as possible but it didn't happen for a long time. After a while, I remember being struck by lighting when I was trying to save my sister and everything changed after that. Nothing was the same I became completely a different person. I could literally save whoever I wanted, by healing them. And hide myself from anyone I wanted and to show myself to those I wanted.</p>
		<h3>What would I do with it</h3>
		<p>When I, figured out about my super powers. I always wondered what I would do with it. Till one day when I decided to help people since I have got the healing power and that I could heal people so what I would do would be invisible myself and help people. That way I could do generous things without people having to give me recognition for what I did. Also, to go around at nighttime see if someone has a health issue and can not afford the medication and stuff I would help them while they are sleeping and put a letter and telling them to thank god and that they are absolutely fine</p>

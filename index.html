		<h2>For a quiz intended to check your understanding of today’s principal topic, what would be a great question?</h2>
		<p> A good question would be add a picture and why put alternative <a href="http://touque.ca/EC/WWW/page_mechanics/A0009.html#intrapageLinksExample"> next page </a></p>
		<h3>What’s the full-marks answer to that question?</h3>
		<p> The dull mark answer would people with diffculity of seeing stuff. In other words you have a picture in your web page and someone has visited your web page they cant see the image. For some propblem with their eye, what they could do would be read the alternative and figure out the picture</p>
